<p>This is where it gets tricky. We have limitations to the lifespan of stars. There is a maximum time when a star could exist. The real problem is that we are receiving light from stars that are too far away so that the light took too longer than the lifespan of the star to reach us. This means, all the stars that are beyond a certain distance are not there!</p>

<p>Even the stars within the distance boundary that would define the border of the maximum lifespan of a star that light could travel in, will still be in various stages than what we see them now. What we see as primitive stars a million light years away would really be hosting planets as we see them. When we look in the skies, we are only seeing the past. When scientists look at the center of the galaxy for a black hole activity, they are looking into thousands of years in the past. When the scientists are looking into the furthest edges of the universe, they are looking into something that is not there. When we see distant galaxies that are millions of light years away, there might actually be not a single star at all. They all could have become extinct at the time when the light reached us.</p>

<p>Not only we are seeing things that are not there, but we are also not seeing things that out there. Imagine the star light coming from a very bright star towards the earth from a hundred light years away. Now please imagine that a planet sized cosmic body started traveling through the earth from the same direction. Can you imagine what happens if that cosmic body came into alignment with the light that was travelling towards earth? The light would still be travelling towards us and then there is this cosmic body in the middle of the light beam blocking the rest of the light beam to come to us. Will we see the cosmic body yet? No, we will not; because we will still be seeing the star as all what we receive is the light from the star. If the cosmic body blocked the light some two light years away from earth, then it would take us two years to see that cosmic body. And it is not just light and visibility to the telescopes. Whatever device you use and whatever ray you are looking for, you will not see the body yet because the light from that body has not reached you. If that body was travelling closer to the speed of light, then when you realize that there is something, that thing would already be closer to you.</p>
